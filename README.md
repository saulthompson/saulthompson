## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Saul.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a fullstack engineer based in Seattle, WA.

ðŸŒ± I recently created [Flytrap](https://getflytrap.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted error monitoring solution for web applications. It uses Terraform for automated architecture provisioning directly on your AWS account, so you maintain control of your data, your infrastructure, and your error monitoring costs.

ðŸ“— You can check out the Flytrap [case study](https://getflytrap.github.io/case-study/) to learn more.
